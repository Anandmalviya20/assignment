functions can generally be classified into four basic types :
1)built in functions
2)defined by user
3)lambda functions
4)recursive functions

1)built in functions- 
        -these are function that are provided by python as a part of standard library.
        -they are always available for use without needing to import something
        -example- print(), len(), type(), int(), str(), sum() etc. 
2)defined by user-
        -these are function that are defined by user to perform specific task .
        -example-
        def greet(name):
            return f"Hello, {name}!"
3)lambda functios:
        -these are small, anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword.   
        -ex.
        add = lambda x, y: x + y
        print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5

4)recursive functions:
        -These are functions that call themselves in order to solve a problem. 
        They are often used for problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems, 
        such as calculating factorials or Fibonacci sequences. Example:
            def factorial(n):
            if n == 0:
                return 1
            else:
                return n * factorial(n-1)
